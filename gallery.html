              The two images seen on the left are a before and after of our very
              first cat at the facility called Miro. He is of a Ragdoll breed
              which are distinct for their colorprint coat and their bright blue
              eyes. The image on the left is when we first found him and the
              image on the left is around the time he turned 1 years old. Miro
              has a very bi-polar personality as he sometimes shows his extreme
              energy or his extreme laziness, but he is fantastic regardless. He
              was born on March 25, 2022.

              This is Ruby, an 11 year old Golden Retriever, a breed known for
              their undeniable loyalty and affection. Ruby is incredibly
              friendly, generous, and gentle. Unfortunetly, the older a pet is,
              the less likely they are to be adopted. However we are happy to
              say that Ruby was rescued by a family in Connecticut, eager to
              welcome this joyous dog into their home.

              To the left are Chikies and Milo. These two brother and sister
              Shih-tzus puppies are 6 months old and are looking for a good
              home. Adopting this pair is a great option to allow them to burn
              off that crazy puppy energy. Shih Tzus are a social breed, not
              only do they love to be around humans, but they enjoy the company
              of other dogs too. To the right is Frog. He is two years old and
              was found in the alley. Although he's socially awkward he will
              grace you with a heartwarming headbutt that will make you feel
              special.

              Meet Kemba and Kali, Miniature Poodle siblings, a breed renowned
              for their intelligence and lively personalities. Despite being
              siblings, they each have their own quirks - Kemba is the more
              adventurous of the two, while Kali loves to snuggle up for a
              cuddle. Often, potential adopters may overlook bonded pairs,
              fearing the additional responsibility. However, we are thrilled to
              share that these spirited siblings found their forever home with a
              loving family in New Jersey, who are eager to embrace the double
              dose of joy and companionship.
