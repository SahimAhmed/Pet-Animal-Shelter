          <h1>Saving One Pet at a Time</h1>
          <p>
            Our Pet Rescue Shelter is a non-profit organization devoted to the
            care and love of our furry friends. Our team works tirelessly to
            nurture abandon pets; we provide them with attentive vet care,
            quality food, and calming environments. However, our pets need a
            home.
          </p>
          <p>
            We offer meet and greets with our pets, through which you will
            receieve information about each animal to find which one is the
            perfect fit for you. Each one of our animals are unique, but they
            all have lots of cuteness and love to give! Our goal is to help you
            find a pet who will fill your life with love and companionship.
          </p>

          <h1>Why We Care</h1>
          <h3>Only 10% of dogs born find a permanent home</h3>
          <h3>
            There are roughly 30-40 stray and uncared for cats in the United
            States
          </h3>
          <p>
            At the Pet Rescue Shelter Center, we seek to educate pet owners on
            the dangers of abadnonment and mistreatment. We, as well as many
            other shelters in the nation, see more animals entering our center
            than leaving to a loving home. Many of our animals are also left to
            experience life long trauma and health problems. They deserve better
            than this.
