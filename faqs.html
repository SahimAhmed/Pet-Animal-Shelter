          <h1>FAQS</h1>
          <p>The Following are Question which we recieve most often:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Are all the pets which you rescue up for adoption?</dt>
            <dd>
              Yes and no, since before we put the rescued pets up for adoption
              we must first ensure that the animals are ready phsycially and
              mentally to be around humans first. After that we must also ensure
              the individual(s) who is looking to adopt is a good fit for our
              pets for the safety of the animals so they don't go through what
              they did previously.
            </dd>

            <dt>What does it cost to adopt a pet from the shelter?</dt>
            <dd>
              They generally range from $25 to $250. Sometimes the pets are if
              there is a special promotion we have going on, usuallly during
              Holiday Time.
            </dd>

            <dt>How long have you guys been around for?</dt>
            <dd>
              We are a generally new Pet Rescue Shelter as we just opened our
              facility and cause out to the public on May 9th, 2023. However, we
              have been rescuing pets and been providing for them for a few
              months now.
            </dd>
            <dt>How long does the adoption porcess take?</dt>
            <dd>
              The adoption process can range from a mere few minutes to a few
              days. It all depends on the various policies which we have for
              specific pets as well as how well we feel the connection the
              people are adopting have with the animal.
            </dd>
